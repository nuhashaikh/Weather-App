# Weather-App  

**Description**: The Weather-App  prompts the user for an input of a city. The user must input a valid city name and then press the search button. Using a weather API, the app will then display the current
weather outlook, winds, temperature, feels like temperature, maximum temperature, minimum 
temperature along with the longitude and latitude of the city that is being looked at.

**Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript->JQuery and Netlify

**Wish List Feature**: I definitely hope to improve the CSS additionally also display 
current time+time difference between the place the user is searching from and the city being searched.
I also want to add in 7 day forecast section.
